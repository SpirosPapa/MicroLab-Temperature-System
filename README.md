# MicroPython Temperature Server

This is a MicroPython project that creates a local network server for temperature logging. It utilizes the TMP36 analog sensor for temperature measurement.

## Project Overview

The MicroPython Temperature Server is designed for use with microcontrollers supporting MicroPython, such as the Raspberry Pi Pico W. It makes use of multiple cores, dedicating one to periodic temperature logging and another to handling the server. Due to the fact that more than one core is being used this file can only be used in microcontrollers with more than one CPU core.

Included in this repository is a TMP36 class for communicating with the TMP36 sensor. This class is compatible with any MicroPython-capable microcontroller.

## Website Features

The website generated by the server provides the following information:

* Current Temperatures: The site automatically refreshes every minute to display the latest temperature readings.

* Average Temperature for the Current Day

* Maximum Temperature Measured Today

* Historical Data: If the MicroPython server has been running for over a day, a diagram depicting the average temperature for the past 10 days will be displayed.

* Files: Files storing temperatures measured on the current day and the average temperature measured for the last 10 days are available for download.

## How to run
Some short instructions in order to run the code from the repository:
* Change the ssid and password parameters to the name and password of your local network, so that the microcontroller can connect to your local network
* Microcontrollers usually dont have a battery with their RTC in order to store time when they are not connected to a power supply/battery/computer. In order to set the time correctly we use an API to get the time. Set the city that corresponds with your time zone. Also set your API Key from API Ninja. You can get an API Key from here

* The implementation that use the ```_threads``` work only for microcontrollers that have more than 2 CPU cores. Note that this micropython library is highly experimental.
